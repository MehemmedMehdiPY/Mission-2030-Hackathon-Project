Solar Potential
	Estimated power produced by solar panel.

Landcover
	Distances from one of undesired landcovers, such as label 10, 20, 50, 80, 90, and 100.
	Only minimum distance among those 6 is chosen. The ideal case is to maximize distances.

Soil Moisture
	Volume fraction of water respect to soil.

Soil Texture
	Distances from one of undesired soil textures, such as label 0, 1, 5, 6, and 9.
	Only minimum distance among those 5 is chosen. The ideal case is to maximize distances.

Slope
	Surface angle in degrees

Aspect
	Surface position with respect to North in degrees. 
	In this dataset, difference between original aspect and average solar azimuth angle was provided.
